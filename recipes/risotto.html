    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This chicken risotto recipe features moist roasted meat, caramelized
      onions, balsamic vinegar, and creamy risotto. You can roast a chicken at
      home or purchase a cooked one from the grocery store. A garnish of grated
      cheese, such as Parmesan or Pecorino Romano, is a nice touch.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
      <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
      <li>¼ cup balsamic vinegar</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups uncooked Arborio rice</li>
      <li>¼ cup dry white wine</li>
      <li>7 cups hot chicken broth</li>
      <li>2 cups chopped cooked chicken breast</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat.
        Sauté onion in hot oil until dark golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Remove from heat and stir in balsamic vinegar; set aside.</li>
      <li>
        Heat remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium
        heat. Cook and stir rice in hot oil for 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Pour in wine while stirring. Reduce heat to medium-low.</li>
      <li>Pour in 1 cup hot broth; cook and stir until broth is absorbed.</li>
      <li>
        While stirring constantly, continue adding remaining broth, 1 cup at a
        time, until all broth is absorbed and rice is tender yet firm to the
        bite, about 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in reserved onion mixture until heated through. Remove from heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in chicken and butter; season with salt and pepper. Garnish each
        serving with thyme.
      </li>
    </ol>
